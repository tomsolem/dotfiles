# dotfiles
My dear dotfiles. Based on other dotfiles found laying around.

## Prerequisite - before running dotfiles
Update mac with latest version:
```
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
```
Next we need to install git. I chose to use xcode (not sure this is the best?):
```
xcode-select --install
```
The we should check to see if brew is installed and install it?
