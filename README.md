# dotfiles

My dear dotfiles. Based on other dotfiles found laying around.

## Prerequisite - before running dotfiles

Update mac with latest version:

```shell
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
```

Next we need to install git. I chose to use xcode (not sure this is the best?):

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

Then we should check to see if brew is installed and install it? -> start to create a dotfile script.
